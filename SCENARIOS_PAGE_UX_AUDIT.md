# Scenarios Page UX Audit & Assessment

## Using Same Framework as Assets Page

### Current Scenarios Page Architecture Review

**Current Structure:**
- `app/scenarios/page.tsx` → `ScenariosHeader` + `ScenariosGrid` → `ScenarioCard`
- Basic creation via simple mutation (no modal)
- Comprehensive editing via `ScenarioEditModal` (4-card interface)
- Standard search and filtering functionality

### Detailed Scoring Against Framework

#### 1. Intuitiveness: **6.0/10**

**Strengths:**
- Clean grid layout easy to scan
- Type-based color coding helps categorization
- Dropdown menus for actions are discoverable

**Critical Issues:**
- **No Phase 2 workflow context** - Missing positioning in 4-phase process
- **No workflow guidance** - Users don't understand scenarios' role
- **Inconsistent with Assets page** - Different header style and layout
- **Missing breadcrumbs** - No clear relationship to other phases

#### 2. Simplicity: **5.0/10**

**Strengths:**
- Single-button creation process
- Clear search and filter interface
- Straightforward card-based presentation

**Critical Issues:**
- **No quick creation options** - Only basic placeholder creation
- **Edit functionality broken** - (line 63: TODO comment, console.log)
- **No contextual creation guidance** - Users don't know what scenarios to create
- **No template or example scenarios** - Starting from scratch is difficult

#### 3. Aesthetic: **7.0/10**

**Strengths:**
- Consistent card design with good spacing
- Effective use of badges and color coding
- Professional typography and icons

**Issues:**
- **Header inconsistent** with assets page styling
- **Empty state too basic** - Missing engaging visuals and guidance
- **No workflow branding** - Doesn't feel part of Phase 2

#### 4. Workflow Completeness: **4.0/10**

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive edit modal with probability sliders
- Delete functionality works correctly
- Search and filtering operational

**Critical Issues:**
- **Edit functionality disconnected** - Modal exists but not connected
- **No scenario templates** - Unlike assets, no guided creation
- **No Phase 2 guidance** - Missing workflow context and next steps
- **No relationship to Phase 1** - No connection to assets created
- **No validation or examples** - Users don't know what good scenarios look like
