Protected industries may become less competitive over time without pressure from foreign rivals. Additionally, trading partners frequently implement retaliatory tariffs, which can escalate into broader trade conflicts.",
    "generated_answer": "Tariffs have multifaceted effects on international trade. By increasing the cost of imported goods, they can shield domestic industries from foreign competition, particularly in sectors considered strategically important or those employing significant numbers of workers. Tariffs generate government revenue but typically reduce overall economic efficiency and diminish total trade volume. Industries protected by tariffs often become less competitive over time as they face reduced pressure to innovate and improve productivity.

    ],
    "reference_answer": "Fractional reserve banking creates money supply because banks keep only a portion of deposits as reserves while lending the rest. When banks issue loans, they create new deposit money that didn't previously exist. This deposit multiplier effect enables the banking system to expand money supply beyond central bank currency. The money multiplier equals the reciprocal of the reserve requirement—a 10% requirement creates a potential 10x multiplier.",
    "generated_answer": "Fractional reserve banking creates money supply through a systematic process of deposit-taking and lending. Banks are legally required to maintain only a fraction of customer deposits as reserves, while lending out the remainder. When a bank issues a loan, it creates new deposit money in the borrower's account that didn't previously exist in the economy, effectively expanding the money supply. This process initiates the deposit multiplier effect, where these newly created deposits can be re-deposited and partially re-loaned throughout the banking system, multiplying the initial deposit's impact on money supply. Theoretically, the maximum money multiplier equals the reciprocal of the reserve requirement—for example, a 10% reserve requirement could create a 10x multiplier, though actual multiplication is typically lower due to cash leakage and excess reserves."

    "reference_answer": "Governmental fiscal policy influences inflation through multiple channels. Expansionary policies involving increased spending or tax cuts stimulate aggregate demand, potentially creating inflationary pressures when demand exceeds productive capacity. Government borrowing to finance deficits may crowd out private investment or increase the money supply if monetized. The actual inflationary impact depends heavily on prevailing economic conditions, particularly unemployment levels and capacity utilization.",
    "generated_answer": "The relationship between governmental fiscal policy and inflation is complex and context-dependent. Expansionary fiscal policy, characterized by increased government spending or reduced taxation, typically stimulates aggregate demand in the economy. When this additional demand exceeds the economy's productive capacity, inflationary pressures emerge as too much money chases too few goods and services. Government borrowing to finance budget deficits can potentially crowd out private investment by increasing interest rates, or if central banks purchase government debt (monetization), it can expand the money supply and further fuel inflation. However, the inflationary impact of fiscal expansion varies significantly depending on prevailing economic conditions—during periods of high unemployment and economic slack, fiscal stimulus may primarily increase output rather than prices, while the same policies during near-full employment would more likely generate inflation."
