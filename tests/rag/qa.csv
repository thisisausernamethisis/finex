What is RAGAS and how is it calculated?,RAGAS (Retrieval Augmented Generation Assessment Score) is a metric that evaluates the quality of RAG systems by combining measures of faithfulness (accuracy relative to context), context relevance (how useful the retrieved content is), and answer relevance (how well the response addresses the question).
How does a scenario relate to themes in the data model?,A scenario in the data model can contain multiple themes, creating a one-to-many relationship where themes inherit the scenario context but can explore specific aspects or dimensions of that scenario.
What happens if a matrix analysis fails?,If a matrix analysis fails, the system updates the status to "failed", records the error message, emits a job failed event, and no impact score or summary is generated for the asset-scenario combination.
How are asset permissions enforced?,Asset permissions are enforced through a combination of RBAC (Role-Based Access Control) checks embedded in API endpoints and database queries that filter results based on user roles and relationships.
What criteria are used to determine confidence scores?,Confidence scores are determined based on evidence quality, consistency of information, data recency, amount of contradicting evidence, and the AI model's certainty in its interpretation of the available information.
What is the purpose of the preview endpoint?,The preview endpoint provides a lightweight, fast-access view of matrix analysis results without requiring the full dataset, focusing on key metrics like summary and confidence score for quick assessment.
Can matrix results be explained to stakeholders?,Yes, matrix results include a summary field specifically designed to provide a clear, human-readable explanation of the analysis that can be shared with stakeholders to justify the numerical impact scores.
How is Redis used in the application?,Redis is used for caching search results, managing job queues for background processing, storing temporary session data, and supporting real-time event distribution through pub/sub channels.
What happens when the cache is missed during a search?,When a cache miss occurs during search, the system performs both text-based and vector-based searches, fuses the results with Reciprocal Rank Fusion, records the miss in metrics, and then stores the results in cache for future queries.
How are metrics collected and used?,Metrics are collected using Prometheus clients that track counters, gauges, and histograms for various system operations, which are then used for performance monitoring, alerting on anomalies, and guiding optimization efforts.
What is the relationship between assets and scenarios in a matrix?,The relationship between assets and scenarios in a matrix is a many-to-many relationship implemented through the MatrixAnalysisResult table, which contains the impact assessment of how a particular scenario affects a specific asset.
How do you handle rate limiting for external API calls?,Rate limiting for external API calls is handled through a combination of token bucket algorithms, request queuing, exponential backoff for retries, and circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures during service disruptions.
What information is included in a matrix result?,A matrix result includes the asset and scenario identifiers, an impact score (-5 to +5), a textual summary explaining the reasoning, a confidence score indicating analysis reliability, evidence IDs supporting the conclusion, and status information.
How are themes categorized in the system?,Themes in the system are categorized by type (standard, growth, or probability), by custom category strings that users can assign, and by their relationship to either assets or scenarios.
What happens when a new card is created?,When a new card is created, it's associated with a theme, its content is processed into chunks for search indexing, and these chunks are then used to generate embeddings for vector search capabilities.
How are jobs processed in the worker system?,Jobs are processed in the worker system by being added to named queues in Redis, then picked up by worker processes that execute the required task, update the job status, and emit events to notify the system of completion or failure.
What role does OpenAI play in the system?,OpenAI provides the language models used for generating analysis summaries, calculating impact scores, determining confidence levels, and evaluating the quality of RAG results through RAGAS scoring.
How is the RAGAS threshold determined?,The RAGAS threshold of 0.8 was determined through empirical testing that balanced the need for high-quality results against the practical limitations of retrieval systems, representing a level where results are reliable enough for business decision-making.
What happens if search latency exceeds acceptable levels?,If search latency exceeds acceptable levels, the system relies more heavily on cached results, logs performance warnings, increments latency metrics for monitoring, and may trigger alerts for operations teams to investigate potential database or embedding service issues.
How do you balance freshness vs. performance in caching?,Balancing freshness vs. performance in caching is achieved by setting appropriate TTL values (typically 5 minutes for search results), selectively invalidating cache entries when underlying data changes, and using cache warming strategies for frequently accessed data.
What is the purpose of the matrix worker?,The matrix worker processes background jobs to analyze how scenarios impact assets, generating impact scores, summaries, and confidence levels without blocking user interactions, and then persisting these results for later retrieval.
How are theme templates structured internally?,Theme templates are structured internally as JSON payloads that contain a serialized representation of theme properties (name, description, type) along with associated cards and their content, allowing for easy cloning and instantiation.
What determines the order of search results?,The order of search results is determined by a fusion algorithm that combines text relevance scores and vector similarity scores, applying Reciprocal Rank Fusion to balance exact keyword matches with semantic similarity.
How are assets linked to users in the system?,Assets are linked to users through a direct ownership relationship stored in the userId field of the Asset table, as well as through the AssetAccess join table that enables shared access with specific roles for collaboration.
What metrics are tracked for the RAG system performance?,The RAG system performance is tracked through metrics including cache hit/miss rates, search latency, query counts, RAGAS evaluation scores, and worker processing times for matrix analyses.
How are embeddings generated and stored?,Embeddings are generated using OpenAI's embedding models and stored in the database as vector fields associated with content chunks, enabling efficient similarity searches using PostgreSQL's pgvector extension.
What happens during a hybrid search operation?,During a hybrid search operation, the system checks the cache first, and if no results are found, performs parallel text-based and vector-based searches, fuses the results using Reciprocal Rank Fusion, caches the combined results, and returns them to the caller.
How does the system ensure data consistency?,The system ensures data consistency through transactional database operations, optimistic locking for concurrent updates, event-based synchronization between components, and thorough validation of inputs using Zod schemas.
