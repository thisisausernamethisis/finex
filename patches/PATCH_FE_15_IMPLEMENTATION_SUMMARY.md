- ✅ **Progress Visualization**: Progress rings showing completion percentage
- ✅ **Access Control**: Prevents jumping ahead without completing prerequisites  
- ✅ **Visual States**: 
  - Green checkmarks for completed phases
  - Lock icons for inaccessible phases
  - Blue highlighting for current active phase
- ✅ **Connection Lines**: Visual flow between phases with completion status
- ✅ **Mobile Responsive**: Adapted mobile navigation with phase indicators

#### **3. Workflow Progress Component (`components/workflow/WorkflowProgress.tsx`)**
- ✅ **Progress Dashboard**: Complete workflow overview with 4-phase grid
- ✅ **Recommendation Engine**: Next steps with actionable buttons
- ✅ **Phase Completion Banner**: Celebration and navigation to next phase
- ✅ **Progress Bar**: Visual completion tracking (0-100%)

#### **4. Provider Integration (`app/providers.tsx`)**
- ✅ **Context Integration**: WorkflowProvider added to app providers
- ✅ **React Query Integration**: Works seamlessly with existing data hooks

#### **5. Dashboard Integration (`app/dashboard/page.tsx`)**
- ✅ **Workflow Overview**: Added WorkflowProgress component to strategic dashboard
- ✅ **Title Update**: Changed to "Strategic Analysis Dashboard" to reflect workflow focus

## 📊 Technical Implementation Details

### **Workflow Phase Logic**
```typescript
Phase 1 (Asset Research): hasAssets && hasThemes
Phase 2 (Scenario Planning): hasScenarios && hasProbabilities  
Phase 3 (Matrix Generation): matrixCalculated
Phase 4 (Strategic Analysis): Phase 3 complete
```

### **Real-time Data Integration**
- **Assets**: `useAssets()` - tracks asset creation and theme addition
- **Scenarios**: `useScenarios()` - monitors scenario creation and probability setting
- **Matrix**: `useMatrixCalculation()` - detects completed matrix calculations
- **Auto-refresh**: State updates automatically when underlying data changes

### **Visual Design System**
- **Completed**: Green (#059669) with checkmark icons
- **Active**: Primary blue (#4F46E5) with phase numbers
- **Accessible**: Muted with border, shows phase numbers
- **Locked**: Gray with lock icons, disabled interaction

## 🎨 User Experience Improvements

### **Before PATCH FE-15**
- ❌ Random tab jumping between Assets/Scenarios/Matrix
- ❌ No guidance on workflow progression
- ❌ Users confused about proper sequence
- ❌ No progress tracking or completion status

### **After PATCH FE-15** 
- ✅ **Guided Sequential Flow**: Clear 1→2→3→4 progression
- ✅ **Visual Progress**: Phase circles with completion states
- ✅ **Smart Recommendations**: "Create your first asset" guidance
- ✅ **Access Control**: Cannot skip ahead without prerequisites
- ✅ **Real-time Updates**: Progress reflects actual user actions
