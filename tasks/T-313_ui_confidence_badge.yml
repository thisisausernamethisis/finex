title: "ui_confidence_badge â†’ Create React confidence badge component"
branch: "phase7.2/ui-badge"
effort: "S"
depends_on:
  - "T-312"
acceptance_tests:
  - "Storybook snapshot shows confidence badge"
  - "Lighthouse performance unchanged"
  - "Badge shows confidence percentage with tooltip"
notes: |
  Implementation approach:
  1. Create React component in frontend/components/ConfidenceBadge.tsx:
     - Grey pill design with percentage display
     - Tooltip showing more detailed confidence information
     - Various visual states based on confidence level
  
  2. Integrate with API response:
     - Pull confidence data from API response
     - Handle missing confidence values gracefully
     - Format percentage display appropriately
  
  Technical implementation:
  - Minimal component design for performance
  - Consistent with existing UI design language
  - Tooltip will provide additional context on confidence meaning
  - Component will gracefully handle undefined confidence values
  - Performance testing will ensure no regressions
