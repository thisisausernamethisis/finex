title: "yaml_dep_graph — Add depends_on keys"
description: |
  Update the YAML task files to explicitly declare dependencies between tasks. This ensures 
  that the CI step (scripts/ci/validate_yaml.ts) can properly validate that every referenced 
  ticket exists and that there are no dependency cycles in the task graph.

branch: "phase7.1/yaml_dep_graph"
effort: "XS"
owner: "@infra"

acceptance_tests:
  - "CI lint step (scripts/ci/validate_yaml.ts) passes with no errors"
  - "All dependencies accurately declared in the YAML files"
  - "No circular dependencies detected"

notes: |
  This task ensures all YAML files have their dependencies properly declared. 
  The specific dependency declarations are:
  
  - T-302 → [T-301a, T-305]
  - T-303 → [T-302]
  - T-304 → [T-302, T-303]
  - T-301b → [T-301a, T-305]
  
  These dependency declarations match the actual implementation requirements and ensure 
  tasks are completed in the correct order. The validation script already exists and
  will verify these relationships.
  
  Implementation details:
  - Each YAML file should include a `depends_on` array listing the ticket IDs it depends on
  - The tickets listed in `depends_on` must exist in the project
  - No circular dependencies are allowed (e.g., A → B → C → A)
  
  Expected impact:
  - Improved CI validation for task dependencies
  - Clear visualization of task order and relationships
  - Prevention of circular dependencies that could cause project issues
