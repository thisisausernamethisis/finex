  This task implements an SSE (Server-Sent Events) endpoint that provides real-time 
  updates to clients about the status of background jobs. It allows clients to stay 
  informed about long-running operations like matrix calculations without polling.
  
  Key features:
  - Authentication with Clerk
  - EventEmitter pattern for job updates
  - Clean connection handling
  - Proper cleanup on client disconnect
  - Integration with metrics system
