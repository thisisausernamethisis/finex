  This ticket establishes the formal roadmap for the Phase 7.1 Retrieval & Prompting Overhaul.
  It serves as the foundation for all subsequent implementation tickets in this phase.
  The roadmap should follow the same format as previous versions (v0.18, v0.17, etc.)
  with appropriate updates for the new phase.
