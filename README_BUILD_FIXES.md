# Finex Bot Build Fixes Suite

This document outlines the infrastructure and stability improvements implemented in the Build Fix Suite.

## 📋 Summary of Changes

### 1. Dependency Fixes

- ✅ Fixed Clerk middleware import from `@clerk/nextjs` to `@clerk/nextjs/server` in middleware.ts
- ✅ Added path mappings in Jest configuration to match tsconfig.json

### 2. CI/CD Workflow Improvements

- ✅ Added API types check in GitHub Actions CI pipeline
- ✅ Created cross-platform API type generation scripts:
  - Bash script for Unix-based systems
  - PowerShell script for Windows

### 3. Testing Infrastructure

- ✅ Created enhanced contract test setup for route handlers
- ✅ Added authentication utilities for testing
- ✅ Implemented proper mocking for Prisma in tests
- ✅ Added comprehensive EventEmitter unit tests

### 4. Frontend Compatibility

- ✅ Updated Tailwind configuration with v4 compatibility features
- ✅ Enhanced globals.css with a comprehensive design system
- ✅ Added CSS utilities for common UI patterns

## 🔧 API Types Generation

The system now includes cross-platform scripts for generating TypeScript types from the OpenAPI specification:

```bash
# To generate API types
npm run api:generate
```

This command will:
- Use the appropriate script for your platform (bash or PowerShell)
- Generate TypeScript types in the `types/api` directory
- Document any errors that occur during generation

## 🧪 Contract Testing Setup

A new contract testing framework has been set up to ensure API endpoints adhere to the OpenAPI specification:

```typescript
// Example of using the new contract testing utilities
import { GET } from '../app/api/assets/route';
import { executeRouteHandler, parseResponseJson } from './contract/setup';

it('should return a list of assets', async () => {
  const response = await executeRouteHandler(GET, 'GET', '/api/assets');
  expect(response.status).toBe(200);
  
  const data = await parseResponseJson(response);
  expect(data).toHaveProperty('items');
});
```

## 🎨 UI Framework Updates

The UI layer has been updated to support:
- Future Tailwind v4 compatibility
- CSS custom properties for theming
- Improved accessibility patterns
- Dark/light mode support
- Reduced CSS bundle size

## 📝 Usage Notes

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run only contract tests
npm run test:contract

# Run only unit tests
npm run test:unit
```

### CI Pipeline

The CI pipeline now includes the following checks:
1. Linting
2. Documentation integrity
3. API types check
4. Type checking
5. Unit tests
6. Contract tests
7. E2E tests

All must pass for a successful build.
