- **Implementation**: Clean tab-based navigation with active states
- **Icons**: Appropriate icons (Users, Map, Grid3X3)
- **Mobile**: Responsive design with mobile navigation

#### **2. Individual Page Implementation (6/10)**
- **Assets Page**: `app/assets/page.tsx` - AssetBoard component functional
- **Scenarios Page**: `app/scenarios/page.tsx` - Full CRUD with filtering 
- **Matrix Page**: `app/matrix/page.tsx` - Complete matrix visualization with insights

#### **3. Dashboard Overview (7/10)**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL GAPS IDENTIFIED

### **GAP 1: Missing 4-Phase Workflow Guidance**
**Issue**: No visual indication of workflow progression or phase completion  
**Current**: Users can jump between tabs without understanding sequence  
**Ground Truth**: "4-phase workflow clearly indicated in UI"

**Missing Elements**:
- Phase indicators (1/2/3/4) in navigation
- Progress tracking for each phase
- Completion status indicators
- Next steps recommendations

### **GAP 2: No Guided Onboarding Experience**
**Issue**: No tutorial or guided walkthrough for first-time users  
**Current**: Users dropped into complex interface without guidance  
**Ground Truth**: "Onboarding reduces time-to-first-analysis by 50%"

**Missing Elements**:
- Onboarding wizard for each phase
- Sample data templates for quick start
- Interactive tutorials for learning
- Progress tracking analytics

### **GAP 3: Homepage Workflow Integration Weak**
**Issue**: Homepage explains workflow but doesn't integrate with actual pages  
**Current**: Static workflow description without actionable integration  
**Ground Truth**: "Begin Strategic Analysis" should guide users through phases

**Missing Elements**:
- Direct workflow entry points from homepage
- Phase-specific landing from "Begin Strategic Analysis" button
- Contextual guidance based on user progress

### **GAP 4: Missing Portfolio-Level Strategic Dashboard**
**Issue**: Current dashboard shows metrics but no strategic analysis  
**Current**: Basic metrics without "low resolution map of the future"  
**Ground Truth**: "Portfolio heatmap across all scenarios", "Strategic dashboard"

**Missing Elements**:
- Portfolio resilience scoring (0-100)
- Asset concentration risk analysis
- Scenario sensitivity mapping
- Strategic recommendations based on matrix

### **GAP 5: No TAM Integration in UI**
**Issue**: UI doesn't reflect Total Addressable Market functionality  
**Current**: Asset creation/editing missing TAM fields  
**Ground Truth**: "Each asset includes Total Addressable Market projections"

**Missing Elements**:
- TAM input fields in asset creation
- TAM display in asset cards/lists
- Growth/risk ratio calculations in UI
- TAM-based opportunity analysis views
