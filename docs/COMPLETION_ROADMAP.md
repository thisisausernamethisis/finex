## ðŸ”© **PATCH 9.1: Data Integrity Enhancement**
*Priority: HIGH | Effort: 1 day | Dependencies: None*

### **Scope**
Enforce data integrity at the database level for the `Theme` model to ensure a theme is linked to either an `Asset` or a `Scenario`, but not both. This addresses a potential data corruption risk identified during the 360-review.

### **Success Criteria**
- [ ] `prisma/schema.prisma` is updated with the new constraints.
- [ ] A Prisma migration is generated and can be applied successfully.
