# Legacy Helper Inventory (T-174)

## Summary

This document details the process and findings from cleaning up legacy helper modules, as part of ticket T-174.

## Initial State

Initial inventory of legacy helpers:

| Helper File | Location | Status | Replacement |
|-------------|----------|--------|------------|
| objectHelpers.ts | lib/helpers/objectHelpers.ts | Found & Removed | lodash-es |
| dateHelpers.ts | lib/helpers/dateHelpers.ts | Not Found | dayjs (n/a) |
| assertHelpers.ts | lib/helpers/assertHelpers.ts | Not Found | native assert/Zod (n/a) |
| index.ts | lib/helpers/index.ts | Not Found | n/a |

## Findings

1. Only `objectHelpers.ts` was present in the codebase
2. The file contained the following utility functions:
   - `clone<T>()` - Using JSON serialization/deserialization
   - `pick<T, K>()` - Picks specified keys from an object
   - `omit<T, K>()` - Removes specified keys from an object
   - `merge<T>()` - Merges objects (shallow, not deep)

3. All functions were already marked with `@deprecated` comments directing users to lodash-es alternatives

## References Found

No references to these helpers were found in the codebase. After removing the file, all validation checks passed:
- Type checking (tsc): ✅ Pass
- Linting (eslint): ✅ Pass
- Contract tests: ✅ Pass
- ESM compatibility: ✅ Pass

## Conclusion

The legacy helpers were already deprecated and not actively used in the codebase. They have been safely removed, reducing the dependency surface ahead of Phase 6 optimization.
