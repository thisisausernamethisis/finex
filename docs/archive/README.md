## üìö **Archived Documents**

### **MetaMap Product Vision**
- **`ground-truth.md`** - Complete MetaMap product specification (technology disruption analysis tool)
- **`metamap-transformation-analysis.md`** - Gap analysis for MetaMap transformation

### **Completed UX Enhancement Project**
- **`progress-status.md`** - Final status report from completed UX enhancement work
- **`GROUND_TRUTH_ROADMAP_ANALYSIS.md`** - Analysis of UX enhancement vs. planned roadmap
- **`IMPLEMENTATION_COMPLETE.md`** - Completion report for UX enhancements
- **`roadmap-core.md`** - Original roadmap for UX enhancement phases

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Context**

**These documents represent different project initiatives:**

1. **MetaMap Vision** - Product pivot toward technology disruption analysis
2. **UX Enhancement** - Recently completed CRUD interface improvements
3. **Frontend Modernization** - Current initiative (React Query architecture)

**Current Active Project**: Frontend Modernization (see parent directory documents)

## üîç **Key Achievements from Archived Work**

### **From UX Enhancement Project (Completed)**
- ‚úÖ Professional CRUD modals for assets and scenarios
- ‚úÖ Technology categorization fields and enums
- ‚úÖ Complete API endpoints with validation
- ‚úÖ Toast notifications and loading states
- ‚úÖ Seeded technology-focused test data

### **Database Schema Enhancements (Available for Use)**
```typescript
// These enhancements are now part of the codebase:
interface Asset {
  growthValue?: number;
  kind: AssetKind;                   // REGULAR | TEMPLATE
  sourceTemplateId?: string;
  category?: TechnologyCategory;     // AI_COMPUTE, ROBOTICS, etc.
  categoryConfidence?: number;
  categoryInsights?: any;
  isPublic: boolean;
}

interface Scenario {
  type?: ScenarioType;              // TECHNOLOGY | ECONOMIC | GEOPOLITICAL
  timeline?: string;
  probability?: number;
  isPublic: boolean;
}
```

## üìã **How This Relates to Current Modernization**

The **Frontend Modernization** project builds upon the UX enhancements by:

1. **Leveraging Enhanced Models** - Using the improved Asset/Scenario schemas
2. **Modern Data Patterns** - Replacing manual fetch with React Query hooks
3. **Component Architecture** - Isolating business logic from UI components
4. **Developer Experience** - Creating maintainable, scalable patterns

**Result**: The current modernization gets the benefits of the UX work while solving the architectural challenges around data management and component organization.
