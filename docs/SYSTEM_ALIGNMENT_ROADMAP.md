- **Target**: Scenario components and database
- **Changes**:
  - Enhance scenario display with timeline/probability
  - Improve scenario type filtering and categorization
  - Add scenario impact visualization

### **PATCH 2C: Matrix Analysis Enhancement**
- **Issue**: Missing portfolio-level analysis features
- **Target**: Matrix calculation service and UI
- **Changes**:
  - Implement portfolio resilience scoring
  - Add concentration risk analysis
  - Create asset comparison views across scenarios

## ðŸ”„ **PHASE 3: User Experience Optimization (Week 3)**
*Priority: MEDIUM - Workflow improvements*

### **PATCH 3A: Guided Onboarding**
- **Issue**: No clear user journey through 4-phase process
- **Target**: New user experience and dashboard
- **Changes**:
  - Add onboarding wizard for new users
  - Progress indicators for completion of each phase
  - Sample data and templates for quick start

### **PATCH 3B: Strategic Dashboard**
- **Issue**: Missing "low resolution map of the future" overview
- **Target**: Dashboard and insights components
- **Changes**:
  - Portfolio resilience overview
  - Top opportunities/risks summary
  - Scenario impact heatmap
  - Growth/risk discovery recommendations

### **PATCH 3C: Advanced Filtering**
- **Issue**: Limited portfolio analysis tools
- **Target**: Matrix and analysis components
- **Changes**:
  - Multi-scenario filtering and comparison
  - Asset clustering by scenario sensitivity
  - Risk-adjusted opportunity ranking

## ðŸš€ **PHASE 4: Advanced Features (Week 4)**
*Priority: LOW - Enhancement features*

### **PATCH 4A: Scenario Correlation Analysis**
- **Issue**: Missing second-order effects and scenario relationships
- **Target**: Matrix analysis service
- **Changes**:
  - Implement scenario correlation detection
  - Add cascading effect analysis
  - Network effect modeling

### **PATCH 4B: Historical Validation**
- **Issue**: No backtesting for scenario analysis
- **Target**: New analytics module
- **Changes**:
  - Historical scenario performance tracking
  - Model validation against past events
  - Confidence calibration improvements

### **PATCH 4C: AI Enhancement**
- **Issue**: Basic matrix analysis without portfolio intelligence
- **Target**: AI analysis pipeline
- **Changes**:
  - Portfolio optimization recommendations
  - Automated rebalancing suggestions
  - Intelligent scenario generation

## ðŸ“‹ **Implementation Dependencies**

### **Critical Path**:
1. **Phase 1** must complete before user testing
2. **PATCH 2A (TAM)** blocks **PATCH 2C (Portfolio Analysis)**
3. **PATCH 2B (Scenarios)** enables **PATCH 3B (Dashboard)**
4. **Phase 3** should complete before **Phase 4** advanced features

### **Parallel Tracks**:
- **PATCH 1A & 1B** can run simultaneously
- **PATCH 2A & 2B** can be developed in parallel
- **Phase 4** patches are independent and can be prioritized based on user feedback
